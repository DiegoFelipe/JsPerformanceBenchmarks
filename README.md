# Let's find out which ways of coding in javascript are faster!

Here we do some practical exercices and comparisons to determine which ways of doing the same thing in javascript is faster and less memory consuming

For the sake of simplicity use Node's measurement API to measure how much time a algorithm takes to execute

Also we use Nodejs v14.15.3 here if you wanna achieve the same results, all of this test were run on a Mac Mini M1 16GB RAM

Each test run 1k times then we get the avarage of consumed time.
